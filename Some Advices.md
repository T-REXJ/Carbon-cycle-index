# Some Advices

I have reviewed my code in the past two days, and realized that the code is messed up. So I updated the new version of code and pushed it into the new branch "dev". Hope that will look more understandable. I have listed some technologies that may be needed to understand this project and share my personal experience.

* Spring/SpringBoot

  > I recommend following a online tutorial step by step to build a simple demo, then you may have a clear understand about how it works. 
  >
  > Honestly, Spring is like a huge toolkit. It's difficult and unnecessary for us to fully master it. I think it's enough for us to understand how it works. 

* MyBatis

  > If you found the tutorial on official website is difficult to understand, maybe you can search some projects integrated SpringBoot and MyBatis. It may be more understandable to look at code directly , at least I am.

* JavaScript/HTML/CSS/AJAX

  >[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  >
  >[runoob.com](https://www.runoob.com/) 
  >
  >They all have both Chinese and English version. And you can test your code on their page.
  >
  >They also offer tutorials about **Bootstrap** which is very useful to build front pages.

* Thymeleaf

  > Thymeleaf  is a template engine. If you have experience on writing JSP pages or using some other front-end framework, it may be easy to understand. If not, as I mentioned before, finding some projects used Thymeleaf and looking at the code directly may be helpful.

* ~~RESTful API~~

  > At the beginning, I planned to modify the project into a front-end/back-end separated project. But after I review my code, I realized that this kind of system need much more technologies than we have mastered. So I think we better keep it that way and make the back-end render front-end pages directly, which means we no longer need these technologies such as RESTful API.



These are some of my personal experiences, if I think of others, I will continue to update.
